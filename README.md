# Installing and running

Extract javarenderengine.zip file into a folder, which will contain javarenderengine.jar and run.bat.
Double click run.bat which will open console window and graphical main program window.

Alternative way of running the program is to open a console window on the javarenderengine.jar location and type command
"java -jar javarenderengine.jar", which will also show debug output text on the console window. Otherwise console debug output
can be activated in the Java Control Panel or Configure Java application -> Advanced -> Java console -> Show console and
Miscellaneous -> Place Java icon in system tray if the java icon is not already visible on your operating system tray.
