JOGL Render Engine

# Installing and running

Primary running method from console command after downloading javarenderengine.jar file (one line command):

```
java --add-exports java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports java.desktop/sun.java2d=ALL-UNNAMED
     --add-opens java.desktop/sun.awt=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.desktop/sun.awt.windows=ALL-UNNAMED
     -jar javarenderengine.jar
```

Alternative way of running the program is to open a console window on the javarenderengine.jar location and type command
"java -jar javarenderengine.jar", which will also show debug output text on the console window. Otherwise console debug output
can be activated in the Java Control Panel or Configure Java application -> Advanced -> Java console -> Show console and
Miscellaneous -> Place Java icon in system tray if the java icon is not already visible on your operating system tray.
